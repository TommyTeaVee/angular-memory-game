# Memory Card Game with Angular 10

This is a demo project showcasing a memory card game I used to play as a kid (with real cards of course!). It is built in Angular 10, with Angular Material for the buttons, Angular Animations for the card flip effects and images from Unsplash API.

# NB This is work in progress
Cheers :)
